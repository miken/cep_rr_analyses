      "If you want to skip all the fluff, here's a summary of analysis findings:\n",

      "- In the past 8 rounds, the average response rate across the board is 71%. The highest response rate observed is 90% and the lowest is 49%\n",
      "- 95% of the times, we can expect the response rate for a given GPR client to be anywhere between 53% and 88%\n",
      "- No observable differences in how response rates and their progress rates vary by season\n",
      "- Weak correlation between response rate and bounce rate\n",
      "- Weak correlation between response rate and target size\n",
